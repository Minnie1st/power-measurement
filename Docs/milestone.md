# Project Timeline

## Week 1
- Try to understand what we are going to do  
- Familiarize and assemble **Kancony M16V2**  
- Configure analog input and power circuit for first current port  
- Verify accuracy of readings  

## Week 2
- Integrate the code with **TrueRMS** library  
- Integrate the new code with **IoT Empower** framework  
- Flash and configure **ESP32** firmware using IoTEmpower  
- Enable basic communication with cloud or local **MQTT broker**  

## Week 3
- Connect **Kancony M16V2** to **Node-RED** via **MQTT**  
- Create dashboard to display live current readings  
- Add basic alerts/logs  
- Enable switching or multiplexing to measure 3 channels  
- Test for timing and data consistency  

## Week 4
- Integrate sequential or time-multiplexed measurement for all **16 ports** (given only one analog input)  
- Optimize firmware to handle full load efficiently  
- Perform field testing for all ports  
- Calibrate as needed and document
