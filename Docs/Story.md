## Factory-Energy-Monitoring Scenario
### Company Owner: Mr. Alex
### Location: in a developing country

Mr.Alex owns a small factory in a developing country. Electricity costs have been rising, but the exact reason is unclear. The machines run daily, but no one knows how much electricity each machine uses.

To understand the situation, Alex decides to install an energy monitoring system. The system collects electricity usage data from all machines 
A few days later, Alex checks the energy dashboard. The graph shows that some machines are using more power than expected. One section of the factory is consuming energy even during non-working hours. This was not known before.
Alex notes these patterns and investigates further. He finds that several machines were not being shut off properly after work. Some older equipment also showed signs of inefficiency.
He updates the factory’s operating routine and adds simple rules to reduce idle time. Maintenance is scheduled for the machines with high power usage.
Over the next weeks, the energy monitoring system continues to track usage. The factory’s total electricity consumption starts to go down. Monthly reports confirm steady savings.
